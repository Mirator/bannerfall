Original prompt: Make an gameplay audit and suggest 5 things how the gameplay could be improved. Both polishing current features and new features

## Current task

- [x] Measured the phase-4 gameplay audit against the running build (`critiques/phase4/gameplay-audit.md`).
- [x] Tested and rejected the enemy-tuning fixes for "the game plays itself" (`critiques/phase4/self-playing-fix-options.md`).
- [x] Wrote plans 019 (squad orders) and 020 (uneven encounters) and indexed them.
- [x] Implementing plan 019 on branch `codex/squad-orders-slice`.

## Findings

- An idle hero wins the ordinary roaming-party fight with zero casualties, contributing 0 of 625 damage.
- Enemy damage x2, focus-fire, pincer spawns, staggered waves, and even a fully passive troop AI all failed to change that: the encounter is generated favorable (`world.js` guarantees a 0.7-1.2x band) and "kill everything" resolves itself from either side.
- Enemy damage x3 loses the fight only by killing the idle hero while the army loses 2 men: lethality, not decisions.

## Plan 019 implementation

- Branch: `codex/squad-orders-slice`
- Plan: `plans/019-squad-orders-and-stance-tradeoffs.md`
- [x] Step 1: recorded the stance baseline in `tests/e2e/stance-balance.spec.js` before tuning anything.
- [x] Step 2: routed troop AI through per-squad state with a byte-identical measurement (verified inert).
- [x] Step 3: added `SQUAD_CYCLE` (`Tab`) and per-squad orders; `Battle.command` kept as the all-squads aggregate so both legacy contracts pass unweakened.
- [x] Step 4: landed the stance trade-offs (brace, steady aim, charge exposure) and fixed the FOLLOW-vs-raiders grind.
- [x] Step 5: rebuilt the HUD as three squad rows; inspected `shots/plan019/hud-split.png` and `hud-all.png`.
- [x] Step 6: added QA record `squad_selection_and_independent_squad_orders` (inventory now 18).
- [x] Step 7: updated three battle baselines; changes confined to 33,803 px of HUD plus 1,176 px correcting pre-existing staleness.
- [x] Step 8: documented squad/stance ownership and the `toWorld` simulation-input rule.
- [x] Step 9: `npm run test:release` verified; `npm test` passed 50/50.

## Review pass (two subagents) and defect fixes

- A code critic and a casual-player playtest both ran against the slice; their findings overturned the acceptance evidence.
- Premise measured FALSE: over 15 organic camp raids, pressing no order wins 80% (4.3 lost), charging everything 67% (4.9), and the split the spec had certified as best 40% (6.2). Squads now ship as optional depth, not a core mechanic.
- Retracted the unsupported `split beats every uniform order` criterion (held 1/10 seeds independently, 0/5 in my own sweep) and a vacuous test that passed with the feature reverted. Both replaced by an expected failure recording the real camp-raid numbers.
- Retracted the false `AGENTS.md` claim that per-squad hold anchors were in use, and the overstated `tests/README.md` harness description.
- Fixed viewport- and cursor-dependent battle outcomes: formation now hangs off `hero.travelFacing`, not aim. Verified identical across four canvas sizes and three cursor positions, and locked by a regression test.
- Fixed: orders lost to a wiped squad, hold banner never drawing under split orders, `aggregateStance()` counting empty squads, orders swallowed during the intro banner, `Tab` advertised while inert, deploy-banner text overflow, the `CHARGE_EXPOSURE` flicker dodge, `squadStance()` returning `'mixed'`, and defeat advice pointing at the weaker order.
- Added a `brute` fixture and corrected the false brute-counter claim for bracing (nothing but a wolf reaches `BRACE_SPEED`).
- Added `testIgnore: '**/zz-*.spec.js'` — my own instruction to a subagent had put scratch specs inside `testDir`, making `npm test` unreproducible.
- Final: `npm test` 50/50, `npm run test:tooling` 7/7, release token `rada68ae0c75b` verified. Screenshots: `shots/plan019/hud-one-squad.png`, `shots/plan019/hud-split-fixed.png`.
- Plan 020 remains BLOCKED: it needs battles that require a player, which this slice deliberately did not attempt.

## Defects found and fixed along the way

- `Camera.toWorld()` included the shake offset, so decorative shake reached hero facing and FOLLOW formation slots: identical seeded battles measured 45.7s, 30.0s, 45.4s, and 90s. Both legacy determinism records drive CHARGE, which ignores `slotPos()`, so the coverage blind spot matched the defect exactly.
- `bloodlust` only watched for damage, so kiting raiders kept a dead-end fight alive past 90s. A no-death stall clock closes it.
- Two battle baselines had carried an orphaned text region since `2050497` (~0.13%, under the 1.5% diff tolerance), so CI stayed green on a stale baseline.
